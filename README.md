# Football Player Tracker
**AI-powered desktop application** that leverages computer vision and intelligent visualization to analyze football match videos and track players in real-time. ðŸŽ¥âš½

![GUI](Images/1.png)
Designed to analyze and track football players in match videos using YOLOv8 object detection and customized real-time visualization tools. Ideal for analysts, coaches, or researchers interested in player movement and performance metrics.


## Key Features

### Video Processing
- Upload and play full football match recordings  
- Real-time player detection powered by YOLOv8  
- Playback controls: play, pause, progress tracking  
- Frame-by-frame inspection for detailed analysis  

### Player Tracking
- Automatically detect and assign IDs to players  
- Select and track specific players individually  
- Monitor positions and velocities in real-time  
- Visualize movement paths directly on the field  

### Data Visualization
- Interactive 2D football pitch view  
- Live visualization of player trajectories  
- Heat map generation based on player movement  
- In-depth performance and statistics per player  

### Data Analysis
- Monitor player position over time  
- Calculate speeds and movement patterns  
- Export tracking data to CSV  
- Generate comprehensive match statistics
